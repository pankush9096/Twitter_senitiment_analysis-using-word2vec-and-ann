This is solution for Analytics Vidhya Data hackthon on Twitter_Senitiment_Analysis.

The objective of hackthon to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

We will classify a set of tweets into two categories:

racist/sexist
non-racist/sexist

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.
